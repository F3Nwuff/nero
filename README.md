# <h1 align="center">Nero, your Personal Hydration Assistant</h1>

> Think of Nero as your personal hydration assistant. We understand the importance of staying hydrated for overall health and well-being, but it can be easy to forget to drink enough water throughout the day. That's where Nero comes in. Our app helps you track your water intake and reminds you to drink more throughout the day. Our mission is to make staying hydrated easy and convenient for everyone. We believe that by making it simple to track your water intake and set reminders, we can help people achieve their daily hydration goals and improve their overall health. Refer to the poster below for Nero's features.
